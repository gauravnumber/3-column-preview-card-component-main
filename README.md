## Overview

Showcase of three cars.

<!-- Three column side by side when your device width minimum 1440px.
Three row you see when  -->
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

* Desktop version
  ![Desktop](./desktop.png)
* Mobile version

  ![Mobile](./mobile.png)


  <!-- <img src="./mobile.png" width="375" height="500"/> -->
<!-- Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.** -->

### What I learned

In flex container you can create new flex container inside another flex container.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>
  <section class="section-sedans">...</section>
  <section class="section-suvs">...</section>
  <section class="section-luxury">...</section>
</main>
```

```css
main {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column nowrap;
}
```

```css
section {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: column nowrap;
}
```

<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
``` -->
